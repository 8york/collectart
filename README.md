## project on live [coming soon] (https://collectart.fly.dev/)
## MOTIVATION
The aim of this project was to create a community where people who makes "art" can contribute and share their work within a safe space. The term artist is such a broad term and only the small percent of them can share their work in public eyes which can bring both positive and very  negative criticism to the artists. This project aims at creating a space where everyone can share their works, which may not have had a chance to be in public eyes, and inspire each other.
## ABOUT
- COLLECTART was developed with Ruby on rails version 5.2.8.1.
- For running the database, postgresql is in use.
- A CSS file, collectart css, is manages all the styling in the project
- Currently, it has three models, to expand this project more models can be added.
- To run this app, three gems have been installed to run this app, which are  gem 'jquery-rails', gem 'cloudinary' and gem 'bootstrap'
- Cloudinary enables the users to upload their file from their local computer to Collectart app. Credentials can be found in the Cloudinary.yml.
## PLANNING AND APPROACHES
- 3 models were drawn to work out how they associate each other in calidraw.
- Created a new Ruby on rails app.
- Created a database and generated models and controllers.
- Added action to the controllers
- configured routes
- Added views for respective controllers
- Added styles
## Bugs
- No error message shows when an user's login fails
## FUTURE FEATURE
- Adding user email validations
- Adding sing-up validations sent to email address

- Adding 'forget user-name" function to login
- More functionalities can be added to the app to make it more interactive. For example, comment or a platform where the users can communicate/swap works.
## LESSONS LEARNT
The whole project was a challenging for me to use the principles of CRUD system and Ruby on rails. The importanct learning I had was to make use of  console to debug to find out the cause of bugs.
## Credits
Collectart was built as Project 1 for Software Engineering Immersive courser at General Assembly. Great support and assitance from the teaching team, cohort and friends have brouhgt this project alive.
